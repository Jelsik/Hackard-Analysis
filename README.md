# Hackard-Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to predict and assess the potential damages
the fictional company Pewitt Hackard will receive with an upcoming "silver tsunami":
a mass retirement event. Database of employees was filtered through based on conditionals to determine those
employees who were closest to retirement, what department they worked in, and how mamy total their were.

## Results

After conducting the aforementioned anlaysis, we the data team have assembled a series of comments in regard
to the upcoming retirement wave.

Below is an example of the chart determining the total number of affected posisitions

### Comments
1. Despite the veritable flood of imminent vacancies, some respite can be taken in the regard that the number of managers
leaving is only 2. The managers will need to be extra busy to fill absences, but they at least wont be looking to have
to replace themselves.
2. With the previous point standing, however, the other skilled emplyee titles are going to be hit the hardest.
relatively few people will be retiring from assistant positions, but the company will have to hope their younger employee
pool is large enough, or they will have to search far and wide to re-assemble their engineering department.
3. There are only 1550 employees elligable for the mentorship program, assuming 100% of eligable candidates are willing
to take on the burden.
4. Taking note of who is currently retiring within just a few years does not tell the whole story. plenty of other people
born in the fifties have likely been with the company long enough to retire, but would not be included in the range
of 1952-1955

## Summary

One additonal query that needs to be made, is one to see the departmental distribution of the employees in the mentorship
program. Some departments may be more effected than others, and need special attention. Engineering already sticks out,
however.
In league with the first query, a second additional query would need to be made to see the distribution of the mentors throughout
the departments. If a department is lacking mentors, and is also experiencing a large exodus, then external help may need to 
be hired more immediately.

### Exiting Employees

The number of roles that will need to be filled as the "tsunami" begins to impact the metaphorical coastline of PH is large.
More than 50,000 employees alone are ready to retire in the roles of Senior engineer and staff alone. The number of 
retirees shrinks as the seniority of the position does. However, unless there is a simliarly sized pool of young replacements
waiting in the lower roles, a sizeable gap is about to be blown in the core of PH's workforce.

### Mentorship

Cutting to the chase, there are only 1550 mentors eligable candidates for mentorship. This is in comparison to the over
50,000 retiring employees. There are not enough mentors available to properly prepare the next guard. Without proactive
procurement of additional, younger candidates for senior roles, the "tsunami" is going to land hard.
